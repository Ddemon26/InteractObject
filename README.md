## Elevate Your Gaming Experience with Advanced Object Management and Interaction

### Dynamic Object Data Management
**ObjectData:** Seamlessly manage your objects with our robust data structure. Each object in your scene is endowed with a unique ID, a descriptive name, and an engaging description, ensuring that every element in your game world is distinct and memorable.

### Intuitive Object Interaction
**ObjectInteraction:** Engage your players like never before with our state-of-the-art interaction system. Utilize the power of raycasting to detect objects in the player's line of sight, and dynamically update the UI with rich information about the objects they encounter. Bring your game world to life with interactive elements that respond to the player's gaze.

### Immersive Display and Highlighting
**ObjectInfo:** Immerse your players in a world where information is at their fingertips. Our system displays object information directly in the game world, ensuring that players are always connected to the environment. The innovative outline effect highlights the focused object, guiding the player's attention and enhancing the overall gaming experience.

**AssignAimConstraint:** Keep your players engaged with our AimConstraint feature. Ensure that crucial information and highlights always face the player, maintaining immersion and delivering a seamless experience.

### Flexible Interfaces for Customization
**IObjectInfo & IOutline:** Customize the system to fit your game's unique needs. Our interfaces allow you to define how objects should present their information and how they should be highlighted, giving you complete control over the interaction experience.
